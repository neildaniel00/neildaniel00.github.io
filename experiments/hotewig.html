      The camera opens on text that says, "Hi." As the NARRATOR continues to
      speak, we're shown a globe from Google Earth.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Hi, you're on a rock floating in space. Pretty cool, huh? Some
      of it's water. <span id="fuck">Fuck</span> it, actually, most of it's water. I can't even get
      from here to there without buying a boat.
      <br /><br />
      A plane is shown flying from South America to Africa. The plane fades off
      the screen, and a lone, sad stick figure is shown standing on Africa.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: It's sad. I'm sad. I miss you.
      <br /><br />
      The camera pans left across the globe to show more sad stick figures also
      standing on South America, North America, and Europe.
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: How did this happen?
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: A long time ago- Actually, never, and also now, nothing is
      nowhere. When? Never. Makes sense, right? Like I said, it didn't happen.
      Nothing was never anywhere. That's why it's been everywhere. It's been so
      everywhere, you don't need a where. You don't even need a when. That's how
      "every" it gets.
      <br /><br />
      A long pause happens.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Forget this. I wanna be something. Go somewhere. Do something. I
      want things to change. I want to invent time and space, and I know it's
      possible because everything is here, and it probably already happened. I
      just don't know when to start, and that's exactly where it started.
      <br /><br />
      The sound of VCR fast forwarding plays.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Ooh, I paused it. I think there's a universe now. What's it made
      of?
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Quarks and stuff!
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Ah, that's a thing, in a place. Don't like it? Try a new place,
      at a different time. Try to stick together because the world is gonna get
      bigger and emptier, but it's not empty yet. It's still very full and about
      a kjghpillion degrees.
      <br /><br />
      About no seconds pass.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Great news! The quarks are now happily married and in groups of
      three, called a proton or a neutron, and there's something else floating
      around too that wants to join in but can't because it's still too-
      <br /><br />
      An explosion goes off while the screen says, "HOT." 10 minutes pass.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Great news! The protons and neutrons are now happily married to
      each other. Some of them even doubled up.
      <br /><br />
      About 380,000 years pass.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Great news! The electrons have now joined in. Congratulations!
      The world is now a bunch of gas in space, but it's getting closer
      together...
      <br /><br />
      10 million years pass.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: ...and it's getting closer together...
      <br /><br />
      500 million years pass.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: ...and it's getting closer toget-
      <br /><br />
      An explosion occurs.
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: It's a star!
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: New <span id="shit">shit</span> just got made. Some stars burn out and die. Bigger
      stars burn out and die with passion, and make some brand new, way crazier
      <span id="shit2">shit</span>...
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Space dust!
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: ...which allows newer, more interesting stars to be made, and
      then die, and explode into-
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Even crazier space dust!
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: ...so now stars have cool stuff around them, like rocks, ice,
      and funny clouds, which can make some very interesting things, like this
      ball of flaming rocks for example.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Holy <span id="shit3">shit</span>! We just got hit with another ball of flaming rocks,
      and it kind of made a mess, which is-
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Now the moon!
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -4,000,000,000.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Weather update, it's raining rocks from outer space.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Weather update, those rocks might have had water inside them,
      and now, there's hot steam in the sky.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Weather update, cooler temperatures today, and the floor is no
      longer lava.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Weather update, it's raining.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Severe flooding alert! The entire world is now an ocean.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Volcano alert!
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: That's land!
      <br /><br />
      OCEAN: (Mumbles) There's life in the ocean.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: What?
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Something's alive in the ocean.
      <br /><br />
      IMMATERIAL OBSERVER (IO): Oh, cool. Like, a plant or an animal?
      <br /><br />
      The camera zooms in on a single-cell organism.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: No, a microscopic speck. It lives at the bottom of the ocean and
      eats chemical soup which is being served hot and fresh, made from gnarly
      space ingredients leftover from when it was raining rocks or whatever.
      <br /><br />
      The cell divides.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Oh, yeah, and it can do that.
      <br /><br />
      Those cells divide many more times.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: It has secret instructions written inside itself telling it how
      to build another one of itself. So that's pretty nifty, I would say.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Tired of living at the bottom of the ocean?
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Now you can eat sunlight!
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -3,000,000,000.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Using a revolutionary technique, you can convert sunlight into
      food.
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Taste the sun!
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -2,300,000,000.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Side effect, now there's oxygen everywhere and the sky is blue.
      Then the Earth might have been a snowball for a while. Maybe even a couple
      of times.
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -500,000,000.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: It's a sponge. It's a plant. It's a worm, and some other types
      of weird, strange water bugs and strange fish.
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: It's the Cambrian explosion!
      <br /><br />
      IO: Wow, that's animals and stuff.
      <br /><br />
      SEA LIFE: But we're still in the ocean. Hey, can we go on land?
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS, as LAND: No!
      <br /><br />
      SEA LIFE: Why?
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS, as LAND: The sun is a deadly lazer!
      <br /><br />
      SEA LIFE: Oh, okay.
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Not anymore, there's a blanket.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Now the animals can go on land. Come on animals, let's go on
      land.
      <br /><br />
      FISH: Nope, can't walk yet. And there's no food yet, so I don't care.
      <br /><br />
      100 million years pass.
      <br /><br />
      LAND: Okay, will you learn to walk if there's plants up here?
      <br /><br />
      SOME BUGS AND FISH: Maybe
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: ...said some bugs... and fish.
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -380,000,000. The fish coughs because it is having trouble
      breathing. 5 million years pass. The year is now -375,000,000.
      <br /><br />
      AMPHIBIAN: Okay, so I can go on land, but I have to go back in the water
      to-
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Have babies! NARRATOR: Learn to use an egg.
      <br /><br />
      AMPHIBIAN: I was already doing that.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Use a stronger egg. Put water in it. Have a baby, on land, in an
      egg. Water is in the egg. Baby, in the egg, in the water, in the egg.
      <br /><br />
      The year is -312,000,000.
      <br /><br />
      AMPHIBIAN: Works for me.
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Bye bye, ocean!
      <br /><br />
      50 million years pass.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: And now everything's huge. Including bugs. Wanna see a map of
      the land?
      <br /><br />
      IO: Sure.
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -252,000,000. A globe is presented. The camera starts to
      pan around it when a large explosion happens, destroying a land mass on
      the globe the size of a continent.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Oh <span id="fuck2">fuck</span>, now everything's dead. Just kidding, here are the
      survivors.
      <br /><br />
      The thrinaxodon, lystrosaurus, and proterosuchus are shown.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Keep your eye on this one...
      <br /><br />
      The proterosuchus is circled. 75 million years pass.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: ...'cause it's about to become the dinosaurs. Here's another map
      of the land.
      <br /><br />
      The globe is shown again. It does not yet look like the Earth we know
      today; many of the continents are in pieces or out of place.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Yeah, it broke apart. Don't worry about that. It does that all
      the time.
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -66,000,000.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Here comes a meteor.
      <br /><br />
      A meteor comes into frame and hits the globe near what is today called
      Central America.
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: And the dinosaurs are gone!
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: It's mammal time! Here come the mammals; look at those breasts.
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -15,000,000.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Now, they're gonna dominate the world, and one of them just
      learned how to grab stuff, and walk.
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -4,000,000. A transition from one of human's older
      ancestors to one of human's younger ancestors is shown.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: No, like, walk like that, and grab stuff at the same time.
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -3,000,000.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: And bang rocks together to make pointed rocks.
      <br /><br />
      IO: Ouch.
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -1,500,000.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: And set things on fire.
      <br /><br />
      IO: Yeouch.
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -200,000.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: And make crazy sounds with their voice.
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      CAVEMAN: Gneurshk.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Which can mean different things.
      <br /><br />
      Via the CAVEMAN's thought bubble, "Gnerushk," is shown to mean, "Hi,"
      "Bye," and, "Can you hand me that rock over there?"
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: That's a human person!
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: And now they're everywhere, almost.
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -20,000.
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Ice age!
      <br /><br />
      HUMANS: What? You can walk over here? Cool!
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -10,000.
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Not anymore.
      <br /><br />
      HUMANS: Well, I guess we're stuck here now.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Let's review. There's people on the planet, and they're chasing
      their food.
      <br /><br />
      HUMAN: <span id="fuck3">Fuck</span> it, time to plant some grass. Look at this. I control the food
      now. Now, everyone will want to be my friend and live near me. Let's all
      build houses, except mine is bigger because I own the food. This is great.
      I wonder if anyone else is doing this.
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -5000.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Tired of using rocks for everything? Use metal! It's
      underground.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Better farming was just invented in a sweet dank valley right in
      between these two rivers, and the animals are helping.
      <br /><br />
      A sheep baas in the background.
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Guess what happens next!
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: More food, and more people who came to buy the food, and you
      need people to help make the food and keep track of the sales, and now,
      you need houses for people to live in and people to make the houses, and
      now, there's more people, and they invent things which makes things
      better, and more people come, and there's more farming and more people to
      make more things for more people, and now, there's business, money,
      writing, laws, power.
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Society!
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Coming soon to a dank river valley near you. Meanwhile, out in
      the middle of nowhere, the horse is probably being tamed.
      <br /><br />
      DISTRAUGHT HUMAN: Why is all my metal so lame and lumpy?
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Tired of using lame, sad metal?
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -3300.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Introducing-
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Bronze!
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Made from special ingredient tin from the far lands of Tin
      Land... I don't know, my dealer won't tell me where he gets it. Also,
      guess what?
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Egypt!
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -2000.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Meanwhile, out in the middle of nowhere, they figured out how to
      put wheels on a horse. Now, we're getting somewhere. Also-
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: China!
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: And did I mention-
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Indus River Valley Civilization!
      <br /><br />
      A "society count" comes on screen. It lists the four civilizations just
      named (including Mesopotamia). A fifth one suddenly pops on screen. The
      camera pans right across the globe to what is modern day Peru.
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Norte Chico!
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: The Middle East is getting more complicated. Maybe because it's
      in the middle of the East.
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -1600.
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      PEOPLE WITH HORSES: Knock, knock. Er... clop clop.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: It's the people with the horses, and they made an empire, and
      then everyone else copied their horses.
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Greeks!
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Ah, look, it must be the Greeks. Or, a beta version of the
      Greeks. Let's check in with the Indus River Valley Civilization - they're
      gone. Guess who's not gone?
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: China!
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -1200.
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: New arrivals in India! Maybe it's those horse people I was talking
      about, or their cousins, or something... And they wrote some hymns and
      mantras and stuff!
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: You could make a religion out of this.
      <br /><br />
      The year is now -1150.
      <br /><br />

      <br /><br />
      ENGLAND and FRANCE: <span id="damn">Damn</span>.

      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: -In the Caribbean, and it's so god<span id="damn3">damn</span> profitable that you might

      <br /><br />

      NARRATOR: ...and Britain will have to send their prisoners to a different

      CHORUS: Many different types of machines, and factories with machines in
      them, so they can make a lot of products real fast.

      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: ...and dumped it all into the sea, so Britain threw a hissy fit
      and made them open up five cities and give them an island. Britain and
      Russia are playing a game where they try and stop each other from
      conquering Afghanistan. Also, the-

      <br /><br />
      EUROPE: I know! Let's rape Africa.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: ...said Europe, scrambling to see who could rape it the fastest.
      (They never got Ethiopia.) Britain and France are still hungry! (They
      never got Thailand.) The United States ran out of destiny to manifest, so
      they're looking for more.
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Hawaii and Cuba!
      <br /><br />
      IO: Wait! Spain controls Cuba!
      <br /><br />
      UNITED STATES: Well, blame something on them, and go to war.
      <br /><br />

      NARRATOR: China is so tired of being bossed around that they delete their
      old government and make a new, stronger government, which is accidentally
      weaker and controlled by a guy from the previous government. Europe hasn't
      had a war since the last war...
      <br /><br />
      The year is now 1914.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: ...so they start World War I. Look at those guns! It's gonna be
      a "Great War" - so great we won't need a second one. After it's over, they
      blame Germany.

      <br /><br />

      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: Except Turkey! Turkey makes a brand new Turkey!
      <br /><br />

      A phone rings.
      <br /><br />
      IO: Hello?
      <br /><br />
      THE 1920s: Yes, it's the 1920s calling. Let's get in a car and drive to a
      party and listen to jazz on the radio and go to the movies. The economy is
      great, and it will probably be great forever- just kidding!
      <br /><br />
      A slide whistle with decreasing pitch briefly plays. The year is now 1933.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Germany is back, featuring Hitler, the angry mustache model, and
      he's mad at the Jews for existing. Japan is finally conquering the East,
      and they're so excited...
      <br /><br />
      The year is now 1937.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: ...they rape Nanking way too hard. They should probably just
      deny it.
      <br /><br />
      The year is now 1945.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Hitler's out of control, so the international community tackles
      him and tries to explain why killing all the Jews is a bad idea. But he
      kills himself before they could explain it to him.
      <br /><br />
      CHORUS: That's World War II!

      States versus Japan! Fight!
      <br /><br />
      A drop down menu that reads "weapon select" pops up, and the U.S. cursor
      moves down from "boat" to "plane" to "extinction ball." It is picked,
      dropped on Japan, and an explosion results. The year is now 1945.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: (Like Announcer from Mortal Kombat) Finish him!

      <br /><br />
      GANDHI: Wow, that worked?
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Bonus! Now, there's Pakistan. Actually, two Pakistans; one of
      them can be Bangladesh later. The Jews and the Arabs finally figured out
      which one of them should live in the Holy Land.
      <br /><br />
      JEWS and ARABS: Me! NARRATOR: ...they both said at the same time. The year

      <br /><br />
      REPUBLIC of CHINA: No, thanks.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: ...said the other China, escaping to an island. I wonder which
      one is the real China?
      <br /><br />
      The year is now 1950.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: There's the Korean War: Korea versus Korea. Nobody wins and then
      it's on pause forever. Let's meet the sponsors! Oh, it's the two global
      superpowers. They're having a friendly debate over which economic system
      is good and which one is an evil virus of Satan. And they both have atom
      bombs.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: (With an echo) FIGHT!
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Wait, no, that would be the end of the world. Let's just keep it
      cool and spy on each other instead, and make sure we have enough atom
      bombs.

      themselves.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Europe is tired of pillaging other continents, and the
      continents they were pillaging are tired of being pillaged. So here's a

      pillaged by.
      <br /><br />
      The year is now 1963.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: The United States finally decided whether racism is good or bad.
      They decided it's bad, and the world agrees. South Africa might need
      another minute to think about it. Let's check the world population.
      <br /><br />
      A graph is shown, displaying a spike upward in population that jumped from
      "a billion" at the beginning of the 1800s to "way more" around the

      IO: Whoa... Okay.
      <br /><br />

      <br /><br />
      The year is now 1991.

      <br /><br />
      A chart of the 2008 economic recession is shown.
      <br /><br />
      NARRATOR: Whoops, the economy just crashed. Don't worry, the big banks
      won't fail because they're not supposed to. Surprise! Flying robots, with
      bombs. Wanna print a brain? Some people have no friends, some people have
      no food, the globe is warming-
