Hey! I'm neildaniel00, and this I like coding. You can go to my website, which is neildaniel00.github.io to learn more about me, steal my stuff, and play my games! My motto is "Press Ctrl+U to steal", because I make small scale projects for people to fork and build on. You don't have to give credit to me, but it would be nice.
You can find out more about making a website like this by googling "Github Pages".
Thanks! Bye.
