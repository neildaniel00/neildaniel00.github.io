Hey! I'm neildaniel00, and this is my website. You can go to my website, which is neildaniel00.github.io to learn more about me and play my games!
You can set up your own website for free by making a repository with your username followed by .github.io. It would look maybe like blaze8834.github.io. Then make an index.html file, and you're set.
You can find out more about this by googling "Github Pages".
Thanks! Bye.
